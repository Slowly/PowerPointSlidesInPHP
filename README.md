# PowerPointSlidesInPHP
This is a template in PHP for viewing PowerPoint presentations (or any other presentation) as web pages. Just convert the Powerpoint presentation into a set of graphics files, change some root variables in the template, and it works on anything that has a web browser, not just powerpoint on windows.
